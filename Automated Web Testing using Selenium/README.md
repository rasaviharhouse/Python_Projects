## Automated Web Testing using Selenium

### Scope:

Selenium is a powerful open-source framework for automating web browsers. Its primary purpose
is to facilitate automated testing of web applications across various browsers and platforms. Selenium supports multiple
programming languages, making it versatile for
developers and testers.

### Purpose:

The main purpose of Selenium is to enable the automation of repetitive tasks related to web
browser interaction. It's widely used for functional testing of web applications, ensuring they work
as intended across different browsers. Selenium can also be utilized for web scraping, performance
testing, and as a part of the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

### Example Usage (Browser Extension):

Selenium browser extensions, such as "SeleniumIDE" for Chrome, provide a user-friendly way to
record, edit, and playback tests directly within the browser. Users can visually interact with a
website, and the extension records those interactions as test steps. This is particularly useful for
those who may not have extensive programming knowledge but want to create basic tests.

### Example Usage (Python):

Selenium with Python is a powerful combination for more complex and customized test scenarios.
Using Selenium with Python, testers and developers can write scripts that go beyond the
capabilities of a browser extension. For instance, they can perform data-driven testing, handle
dynamic web elements, and integrate tests into larger test suites.

Selenium with Python proves to be a robust and versatile GUI testing tool. Its extensive features,
combined with the flexibility of Python scripting, allow for comprehensive testing of web
applications. The tool's strong community support, documentation, and compatibility across
browsers contribute to its effectiveness in GUI testing.

## Country Search Application Description:

Country Search App is a simple web application developed in Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS and,
bootstrap. It collects some basic country related information from the user and
displays some details of the country selected by the user.

### Version 1 GUI design:

It follows a straightforward 3-page flow, starting from the home page to the country search page
and finally to the country details page. The individual pages implement some of the UI features
like buttons, textboxes, labels, sliders, images, lists, and radio buttons.

### Version 2 GUI design:

The V2 GUI design has the same number of webpages and the same functionalities as of V1 GUI.
There are several differences made in the location, size, orientation, and background color of the
UI elements in V2 GUI. Also, the flow of pages starts from Country Search page, and then to
country details page, and finally to “country app” or the home page in V1 GUI.

### Running the Selenium Test Cases:

1. To run the testcases in localhost:8080, http-server is to be installed via the node package manager, if not installed already. <br>
2. Run the command `http-server` under the gui_v1 and gui_v2 directories to start the 1st application and the 2nd application
respectively. <br>
3. Run the associated python test files.
